The Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) was founded in 2001 to coordinate the efforts around the
Jabber protocol and its implementations. By late 2002, the JSF had submitted the core protocol specifications
to the IETF process, and an IETF working group was formed. In October 2004, this standards
process produced improved versions of the Jabber protocols, renamed XMPP, documented as
RFCs 3920, 3921, 3922, and 3923.

During the protocol’s early life, developers continued to expand its possibilities by submitting
protocol extensions to the JSF. These extensions were called Jabber Extension Proposals (JEPs).

Eventually the JSF and the extensions followed the naming change from Jabber to XMPP and
became the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) and XMPP Extension Proposals (XEPs).

        - user bekommt alles was an rosterkontakten zu dem interest gepostet wird
